On-demand project: simple website for Driving School "Zrno"

Based on the knowledge acquired in university education as well as in independent work, and at the request of the client, I designed and wrote (in fact - I am still writing) the code for the website of the Driving School "Zrno". The site has several links made on demand of the client, but all the content in it is my idea and design, as previously mentioned. The site is currently not responsive, but responsiveness is part of the final solution, so the plan is to, when I finish the "onlinetestovi.html" page, make the finished page compatible for all types of devices. I plan to work on the page "onlinetestovi.html" using a combination of HTML, CSS, JS and React.js technologies. The "onlinetestovi.html" site design is attached in the repository and I am currently working on it.
